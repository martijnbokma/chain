## 🎯 Why "Chain"?

**Chain** is more than just a name — it's a metaphor for what this tool does:

### 🔗 The Chain Metaphor
- **Connection**: Like a chain, it connects all your AI editors together
- **Strength**: Each link (editor) strengthens the whole system
- **Unity**: All editors work as one unified system
- **Flow**: Information flows smoothly through every link in the chain

### 🤖 The AI Connection
The name "Chain" perfectly captures the AI aspect:
- **Chain of Thought**: Just like AI reasoning, your rules flow through a logical chain
- **Blockchain**: Modern, secure, and distributed — like your AI configurations
- **Supply Chain**: Efficiently distributes content to all your AI tools
- **Value Chain**: Each editor adds value to your development workflow

### 🚀 Why It Works
- **Memorable**: Short, simple, and easy to remember
- **Technical**: Sounds modern and professional
- **Universal**: Works across all languages and cultures
- **Descriptive**: Represents exactly what the tool does — chaining everything together

**Chain**: Where AI meets connectivity, creating a seamless development experience across all your editors.

---

**🎯 What you need to do:**
The installation wizard will ask which AI editors you use. Choose the editors you have:

```
? Which AI editors do you use? (Space to select, Enter to confirm)
❯◉ cursor     # Use spacebar to select
 ◉ windsurf   # Enter to confirm
 ◉ claude
 ⬡ kiro
 ⬡ trae
 ⬡ gemini
```

**💡 How does the interface work?**
- **Arrow keys**: Navigate through the list
- **Spacebar**: Select/deselect an editor
- **Enter**: Confirm your choice

**✅ Check:** At least one editor should be selected.

**🤔 Which editor should I choose?**
- **Cursor**: If you use the Cursor editor
- **Windsurf**: If you use Windsurf from Codeium
- **Claude**: If you use Claude Code
- Choose the one you actually use!

### Step 4: Review Your Configuration

**🎯 What you need to do:**
Open the file `chain.yaml` in your editor (VS Code, Cursor, etc.)

**🔍 What you'll see:**
```yaml
version: "1.0"

editors:
  cursor: true      # ✅ Active if you use this
  windsurf: true    # ✅ Active if you use this
  claude: true      # ✅ Active if you use this
  # Other editors are set to false

metadata:
  name: "My Project"           # Change this to your project name
  description: "Description"    # Short description
tech_stack:
  language: typescript   # e.g: javascript, python, go
  framework: nextjs      # e.g: react, vue, django
  database: supabase     # e.g: postgresql, mongodb
  runtime: node          # e.g: python, docker
```

**✅ Check:** Verify that your tech stack is correctly detected.

**🔧 Need to adjust?** You can manually adjust the fields if Chain detected something incorrectly.

### Step 5: Describe Your Project

# For Windsurf
ls -la .windsurfrules .windsurf/rules/

# For Claude
ls -la CLAUDE.md .claude/rules/
```

**✅ What you should see:** All mentioned files should exist.

**❓ No files?** Check if you selected the correct editor in `chain.yaml`.

---

## 🧪 Verification & Testing

### Test 1: Editor Recognition

**🎯 What you need to do:**
Open your AI editor and check if it recognizes the files.

**Cursor:**
- Check if `.cursorrules` appears in the rules panel
- Verify that rules appear under `.cursor/rules/`

**Windsurf:**
- Check if `.windsurfrules` is loaded
- Verify that skills appear in the skills panel

**Claude Code:**
- Check if `CLAUDE.md` is loaded
- Verify that rules appear under `.claude/rules/`

**✅ How do you know it works?** If you can see the rules and skills in your editor, everything is configured correctly!

### Test 2: Content Test

**🎯 What you need to do:**
Create a simple test rule to see if synchronization works:

```bash
echo "# Test Rule
This is a test to check if sync works." > .chain/rules/test-rule.md
```

Sync and verify:
```bash
npx chain sync
ls .cursor/rules/test-rule.md .windsurf/rules/test-rule.md .claude/rules/test-rule.md
```

**✅ What you should see:** The test-rule.md should appear in all configured editor folders.

### Test 3: Automatic Features

**🎯 What you need to do:**
Check if automatic features work:

```bash
# Check if git hook is installed
cat .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Check if npm scripts were added
cat package.json | grep -A 5 '"scripts"'
```

**✅ What you should see:**
- Git hook should contain a sync command
- package.json should have sync, sync:dry, and sync:watch scripts

**💡 Why is this important?** These automatic features ensure you always work with the latest configuration.

## 🆘 Common Issues & Solutions

### ❌ Problem: "chain is already initialized"

**🔍 What it means:** You're trying to run `init` on a project that's already configured.

**✅ Solution:** 
```bash
# Reinitialize (overwrites existing config)
npx chain init --force

# Or just edit the existing configuration
vim chain.yaml  # or open in your editor
```

**💡 Tip**: Only use `--force` if you want to replace the existing configuration.

### ❌ Problem: "No editors enabled in config"

**🔍 What it means:** All editors are set to `false` in `chain.yaml`.

**✅ Solution:** Edit `chain.yaml` and set at least one editor to `true`:
```yaml
editors:
  cursor: true  # Change from false to true
  windsurf: true
  claude: false
```

**💡 Tip**: Only set editors to `true` that you actually use.

### ❌ Problem: "Content directory not found"

**🔍 What it means:** The `.chain/` folder is missing.

**✅ Solution:** Run the initialization again:
```bash
npx chain init
```

**💡 Tip**: If the folder exists but isn't found, check if you're in the correct project folder.

### ❌ Problem: "Tech stack detection failed"

**🔍 What it means:** Chain couldn't automatically detect your technology.

**✅ Solution:** Manually set your tech stack in `chain.yaml`:
```yaml
tech_stack:
  language: python      # e.g: javascript, typescript, go
  framework: django     # e.g: react, vue, nextjs, flask
  database: postgresql  # e.g: mongodb, mysql, supabase
  runtime: python       # e.g: node, docker, python
```

**💡 Tip**: You don't need to fill in all fields. Only what's relevant for your project.

### ❌ Problem: Sync creates no files

**🔍 What it means:** There's no content in the `.chain/` folders.

**✅ Solution:** Add some content:
```bash
# Add a rule
echo "# My Rule
Follow these conventions..." > .chain/rules/my-rule.md

# Add a skill
echo "# My Skill
Help me with this task..." > .chain/skills/my-skill.md

# Then sync
npx chain sync
```

**💡 Tip**: Chain only syncs files that actually exist.

### ❌ Problem: "Permission denied" errors

**🔍 What it means:** Problems with file permissions.

**✅ Solution:** Check and fix permissions:
```bash
# Check permissions
ls -la .chain/

# Fix permissions (if needed)
chmod -R 755 .chain/
```

**💡 Tip**: This problem mainly occurs on Linux/macOS. Windows users rarely have this issue.

### ❌ Problem: MCP server errors

**🔍 What it means:** Problems with MCP server configuration.

**✅ Solution:** Validate MCP configuration:
```bash
npx chain validate
# Look for MCP-related errors
```

**💡 Tip**: MCP is optional. If you don't use it, you can ignore this section.

### ❌ Problem: Git hook not working

**🔍 What it means:** Git hooks are disabled or have permission issues.

**✅ Solution:** 
```bash
# Enable git hooks
git config core.hooksPath .git/hooks

# Make hook executable
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

**💡 Tip**: If you don't use Git, you can ignore this problem.

### ❌ Problem: Editor not reading generated files

**🔍 What it means:** The AI editor doesn't recognize the files.

**✅ Solution:** 
- **Cursor**: Check Cursor settings > AI > Rules
- **Windsurf**: Restart Windsurf
- **Claude**: Check Claude Code settings

**💡 Tip**: Sometimes you need to restart the editor before new files are recognized.

---

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration (Optional)

> **👋 Beginners tip**: The following sections are optional. You can use AI Toolkit perfectly without these advanced features.

### 📋 Template Inheritance

**🎯 What it does:** Use ready-made templates for quick setup.

```yaml
extends:
  - stacks/nextjs  # Uses Next.js settings

tech_stack:
  database: supabase  # Adds database to template
```

**💡 When to use?**: If you want to start with a standard configuration for a specific technology.

### 🔄 Content Sources (Multi-Project)

**🎯 What it does**: Share rules across multiple projects.

```yaml
content_sources:
  - type: local
    path: ../shared-ai-rules  # Local folder with shared rules
  - type: package
    name: "@my-org/ai-rules"  # npm package with rules
```

**💡 When to use?**: If you work on multiple projects and want to reuse the same rules.

### 🎨 Custom Editors

**🎯 What it does**: Add support for unsupported editors.

```yaml
custom_editors:
  - name: supermaven
    rules_dir: .supermaven/rules
    skills_dir: .supermaven/skills
    entry_point: SUPERMAVEN.md

editors:
  supermaven: true
```

**💡 When to use?**: If you use an AI editor that isn't supported by default.

### 🔌 MCP Servers

**🎯 What it does**: Configure MCP servers for advanced integrations.

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  - name: filesystem
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "./src"]
    enabled: true
```

**💡 When to use?**: If you want to use MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. This is an advanced feature.

### ⚙️ Editor Settings

**🎯 What it does**: Automatically generate editor settings.

```yaml
settings:
  indent_size: 2          # Number of spaces for indentation
  indent_style: space     # Use spaces (not tabs)
  format_on_save: true    # Auto-format on save
```

**💡 Result**: Automatically creates `.editorconfig` and `.vscode/settings.json`.

    paths: ['.chain/**', 'chain.yaml']
jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
      - run: bun chain sync
```

**💡 When to use?**: Only if you use CI/CD and want to ensure consistency.

### 4. Explore Templates

**🎯 What to do:** Browse built-in templates in `.chain/skills/` and `.chain/workflows/` and customize them for your needs.
