# Finding Refactor Candidates

Analyze the project and identify files or patterns that are candidates for refactoring based on code quality metrics and project conventions.

## Purpose

To systematically analyze projects and identify refactor candidates by evaluating code quality metrics, architectural violations, and technical debt using static analysis and priority scoring.

## When to Use

- The user asks to find "technical debt" or "refactor candidates"
- A new feature is planned and we want to clean up surrounding code first
- You see patterns that deviate from project standards (e.g., large files or duplication)
- Conducting code health assessments and quality audits
- Planning refactoring initiatives and technical debt reduction
- Identifying high-impact areas for code improvement
- Establishing refactoring priorities and roadmaps

## Constraints

- Always analyze one file at a time for detailed refactoring
- Use objective metrics and scoring for prioritization
- Focus on high-impact, high-risk areas first
- Maintain system stability during refactoring processes
- Validate architectural violations against project standards
- Consider test coverage and risk factors in scoring
- Ensure refactoring recommendations are actionable and measurable

## Expected Output

- Priority matrix with scored refactor candidates
- Architectural violations and separation of concerns issues
- Missing test coverage analysis and recommendations
- Code quality statistics and health metrics
- Phase 1 recommendations for immediate action
- Refactoring pipeline and next steps guidance
- Progress tracking and status management system

## How

### 1. Static Analysis (Scanning)

Use the following commands to find outliers:

- **Size**: `find src -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" \) -exec wc -l {} + | sort -rn | head -20`
- **Any-types**: `grep -r ": any" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"`
- **Hardcoded values**: `grep -r "#[0-9a-fA-F]\{6\}" src/ | grep -v "theme" | grep -v "tailwind"` (loose hex codes)
- **Complexity (Nesting)**: `grep -r "^\s\{16,\}" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"` (deeply nested code > 4 levels)
- **TODOs**: `grep -r -i "TODO\|FIXME" src/`
- **Missing tests**: Look for modules without corresponding test files.

Adapt the `src` path and file extensions to match the project's structure.

### 2. Applying Metrics

Evaluate candidates against these thresholds:

- **Components/Views**: > 350 lines (High), 200-350 lines (Medium).
- **Hooks/Composables**: > 200 lines (High), 100-200 lines (Medium).
- **Services/Modules**: > 300 lines (Medium).

### 3. Architectural Check

- **Module separation**: Are modules properly isolated with clear boundaries?
- **SSOT compliance**:
  - Are types defined in dedicated type files?
  - Are constants centralized?
  - Is data access separated from UI logic?
- **Layering**: Is there UI logic in data layers or data logic in UI components?
- **Test coverage**: Do critical modules have tests?

### 4. Priority Scoring

Rank candidates using a weighted score across four dimensions:

1. **Technical Debt (40%)**: File size, `any` types, hardcoded values, TODOs.
2. **Impact (30%)**: Number of dependent modules (how many things break if this file is bad).
3. **Risk (20%)**: Critical paths (auth, database, payments) and missing tests.
4. **Complexity (10%)**: Nesting depth and cyclomatic complexity.

### 5. Generate Candidates List

After running the analysis, create the candidates list:

1. Run the static analysis commands from step 1
2. Apply the metrics from step 2
3. Check architectural compliance from step 3
4. Calculate priority scores from step 4
5. Generate the candidates list in the format below

## Output Format

```markdown
# Refactor Candidates

> Generated: [DATE]

## Priority Matrix

| # | File | Lines | Tech Debt | Impact | Risk | Complexity | Score | Priority | Status |
|---|------|-------|-----------|--------|------|------------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | path/to/file.tsx | 500 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 16 | CRITICAL | ⬜ |

## Architectural Violations

| File | Issue | Severity |
|------|-------|----------|
| path/to/file.tsx | Data access mixed with UI logic | HIGH |

## Missing Test Coverage

### Modules Without Tests
- moduleName (location)

## Statistics

- Total Source Files: X
- Any-type Occurrences: X
- Architectural Violations: X
- Files > 300 lines: X

## Phase 1 Recommendations

1. **filename.tsx** — Brief description of refactor strategy
2. ...
```

## What to Deliver

The candidates list must include:
- **Priority Matrix**: Table with scores for Debt, Impact, Risk, and Complexity.
- **Top 5 Phase 1**: The most critical candidates for immediate action.
- **Architectural Violations**: List of files violating separation of concerns or SSOT.
- **Missing Tests**: Modules without test coverage.
- **Statistics**: Overview of codebase health.

## Next Steps (Per-File Refactor Pipeline)

After generating the candidates list, process **each file individually** through the following pipeline. This keeps refactors focused, prevents the AI from handling too many files at once, and makes progress trackable per file.

### Pipeline per file

Process files in order of priority score (highest first). Complete the full pipeline for one file before starting the next.

1. **Generate Refactoring PRD**: Use the `refactor-prd` workflow for this specific file.
   - Input: the file path, its scores, and any architectural violations from the candidates list.
   - Output: `docs/prd-refactor-[filename].md`
2. **Generate Task List**: Use the `generate-tasks` workflow with the PRD from step 1 as input.
   - Output: `docs/tasks-refactor-[filename].md`
3. **Execute Tasks**: Work through the generated task list, checking off sub-tasks as they are completed.
4. **Update Status**: Mark the file as completed (✅) in the Priority Matrix.

### Interaction Flow

After presenting the candidates list, ask the user:

> "I have identified [N] refactor candidates. Shall I start with the first file (`[filename]`)? I will generate a Refactoring PRD and task list for it."

Wait for confirmation before proceeding. After completing a file, ask before moving to the next:

> "Refactor for `[filename]` is complete. Shall I continue with the next file (`[next-filename]`)?"

## Managing Progress

Update the Status column in the Priority Matrix as refactors progress:

- **⬜** = Not started
- **🔄** = PRD/tasks generated, implementation in progress
- **✅** = Refactor completed and verified

## Key Rules
- **One file at a time**: Never refactor multiple files simultaneously. Complete the full pipeline for one file before moving to the next.
- **Isolated changes**: Each refactor should be self-contained and not introduce regressions in other files.
- **Context-aware**: Look beyond just lines; understand the impact on the rest of the system.
- **SSOT Focus**: Prioritize fixing duplication and scattered source of truth.
